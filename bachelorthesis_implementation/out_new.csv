0,7226,We introduce different skill groups and production functions into the Burdett-Mortensen equilibrium search model. Supermodularity in the production process leads to a positive intrafirm wage correlation between skill groups. Theory implies that increasing returns to scale can lead to a unimodal earnings density with a decreasing right tail even in the absence of productivity dispersion. Our empirical results indicate economy-wide increasing returns to scale. We use the structural estimates of the production parameters to investigate whether private returns to education equal social returns. Our estimates suggest a positive welfare effect from increasing the share of medium-skilled agents in the workforce.,22321,"The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (JGTRRA) essentially halved the tax rate on dividends and reduced the top tax rate on capital gains. This paper explores the likely effect of JGTRRA on the composition of returns on corporations' common stock. Both larger corporations' past behavior and theory suggest that the recent tax cuts are not likely to increase dividend payouts significantly. Instead, in the short run, dividends will continue to rise in the customary way in response to the recovery in earnings. In the longer run, the tax cuts will principally reduce companies' cost of capital, fostering capital deepening, when the economy is at full employment. With constant returns to scale prevailing at full employment, capital deepening reduces corporations' average gross return on assets and equity. Because the tax cuts increase the value of each dollar of earnings for shareholders, they could raise price-earnings ratios by more than 10 percent and stock prices by more than 6 percent. By fostering capital deepening, the tax cuts also tend to increase the real compensation of labor at full employment.",58791,"Insurance products are distributed both by independent and dependent agents, although the use of independent agents is more costly. The product quality hypothesis states that independent agents provide both insurers and customers with higher service quality and therefore, remain on the market. On the contrary, according to the market imperfections hypothesis both intermediary types offer the same quality, and only coexist due to information asymmetries. Having conducted a written survey, we measure service quality differences by multivariate regression analysis. Our analysis shows that the higher level of service quality of independent agents supports the product quality hypothesis.

Our results show that gay males are: (i) less likely to be continuously employed than their heterosexual counterparts, and (ii) face an earnings penalty of approximately 20 percent, driven, in part, by a longer-run earnings growth penalty relative to heterosexuals. Individual fixed effects estimates show that males entering into same-sex partnerships experience earnings declines relative to those entering into opposite-sex partnerships. For lesbians, we find evidence of an earnings premium, explained largely by increased labour supply on the intensive margin and, to a lesser extent, greater earnings growth over time.",76208,"We develop a novel framework to analyze the structural implications of the marriage market for household consumption patterns. We start by defining a revealed preference characterization of efficient household consumption when the marriage is stable. In particular, stability means that the marriage matching is individually rational and has no blocking pairs. We show that this revealed preference characterization generates testable conditions even if there is only a single consumption observation per household and individual preferences are heterogeneous across households. In addition, the characterization allows for identifying the intrahousehold decision structure (including the sharing rule) under the same minimalistic assumptions. An application to Dutch household data demonstrates the empirical usefulness of our theoretical results.",93184,"This paper studies technology adoption in a cluster of soccer-ball producers in Sialkot, Pakistan. We invented a new cutting technology that reduces waste of the primary raw material and gave the technology to a random subset of producers. Despite the arguably unambiguous net benefits of the technology for nearly all firms, after 15 months take-up remained puzzlingly low. We hypothesize that an important reason for the lack of adoption is a misalignment of incentives within firms: the key employees (cutters and printers) are typically paid piece rates, with no incentive to reduce waste, and the new technology slows them down, at least initially. Fearing reductions in their effective wage, employees resist adoption in various ways, including by misinforming owners about the value of the technology. To investigate this hypothesis, we implemented a second experiment among the firms that originally received the technology: we offered one cutter and one printer per firm a lump-sum payment, approximately equal to a monthly wage, conditional on them demonstrating competence in using the technology in the presence of the owner. This incentive payment, small from the point of view of the firm, had a significant positive effect on adoption. We interpret the results as supportive of the hypothesis that misalignment of incentives within firms is an important barrier to technology adoption in our setting.",5424,dissim,"We use factor analysis to derive a robust measure of religiosity from items reported in five waves of the World Value Survey.

The supply of religion declines once churches lose control over the institutions providing collective goods like education, health, and social security. These goods used to be supplied by churches jointly with religious services but tend to be supplied by the state with rising levels of development.

3,98739,"This study seeks to examine specifically the extent to which the benefit has affected the allocation of time between school and work by children and adolescents. The study takes into account that, in Brazil, it is possible and likely to combine study and work, since the vast majority of schools operate in shifts. We return to this point in our analysis. On the one hand, it can be argued that the programme has beneficial effects on children’s time allocation if it increases school attendance and time devoted to studying and reduces working time. The programme can also be seen as having beneficial effects if it hinders or prevents an increase in the number of working hours, given the strictness in the time devoted to school. In the former case, it is expected that one will observe, simultaneously, an increase in the time devoted to studying and a decline in labour market participation. In the latter, one can observe greater dedication to school without, however, resulting in a decline in labour market participation. Some studies that have reviewed the programme effects on schooling and labour market decisions show a positive effect on school attendance, as well as a decrease in labour market participation, while others show only increased school attendance, without any reduced labour market participation. Taking a middle ground, the results from this paper show that the programme has positive effects on school attendance, but instead of having a negative or insignificant effect on labour market participation, the programme effect simultaneously increases the likelihood of working.

In particular, fiscal consolidations lead to severe contractions when implemented in high private debt states. Contrary, fiscal consolidations have no significant effect on economic activity when private debt is low. These results are robust for alternative definitions of private debt overhang, the composition of fiscal consolidations and controlling for the state of the business cycle and government debt overhang. Private debt-dependent responses are mainly driven by household debt, whereas the effects differ only slightly with the level of corporate debt. Moreover, in high private debt states austerity induces a substantial fall in house prices. Both of these latter findings indicate that deterioration in household balance sheets are important to understand private debt-dependent effects of austerity.

Then, it estimates a set of structural parameters characterizing the dynamics of the labor market using an application of the minimum distance estimation. The estimated model can explain the cyclical behavior of employment, hours per worker, job creation and job destruction conditional on a shock to monetary policy. Moreover, allowing for variation of the labor input at the extensive margin leads to a significantly lower elasticity of marginal costs with respect to output. This helps to explain the sluggishness of inflation and the persistence of output after a monetary policy shock.

6,65084,We introduce and apply a method for estimating workers' marginal willingness to pay for job attributes employing data on job search activity. Worker's willingness to pay for the remaining duration of the employment contract is derived. We provide evidence that workers attach substantial value to the remaining contract duration. A temporary worker with a remaining contract of six months is willing to pay about 10% of the monthly wage to increase the contract by one month.,995,"Does democracy promote economic development? This paper reviews recent attempts to address this question that exploited within-country variation. It shows that the answer is largely positive, but also depends on the details of democratic reforms. First, the sequence of economic vs political reforms matters: countries liberalizing their economy before extending political rights do better. Second, different forms of democratic government lead to different economic policies, and this might explain why presidential democracy leads to faster growth than parliamentary democracy. Third, it is important to distinguish between expected and actual political reforms. Taking expectations of regime change into account helps identify a stronger growth effect of democracy.",2684,"In a contest players compete for winning a prize by exerting effort and thereby increasing their probability of winning.

Taylor showed that a simple central bank reaction function, with the interest rate as monetary policy instrument and inflation and output gap as explanatory variables, mimics the Fed funds rate pretty well during the period from 1987 to 1992. Often, the Taylor rule coefficients are interpreted as if they reflect central bank's preferences. However, this may be misleading. In this paper we show that Taylor rule coefficients are complicated terms consisting of preference parameters as well as parameters given by the structure of the economy. We illustrate our conclusion that Taylor rule coefficients cannot be interpreted as reflecting central bank preferences by estimating standard forward-looking Taylor rules for the Bundesbank, the Fed and UK and confront these with our results obtained by a multi-equation GMM approach in order to detect central bank preferences.",difference,experimentally test,agent half,cooperation,stage centipede game,efficacy,cooperation rates,service,payment,agent receives,benchmark,games increases,1,"[('difference', 16395, 'Rake')]","[('experimentally test', 16395, 'textRank'), ('agent half', 16395, 'Rake'), ('cooperation', 16395, 'TFIDF'), ('stage centipede game', 16395, 'Rake'), ('efficacy', 16395, 'Rake'), ('cooperation rates', 16395, 'Rake'), ('service', 16395, 'Rake'), ('payment', 16395, 'Rake'), ('agent receives', 16395, 'Rake'), ('benchmark', 16395, 'Rake'), ('games increases', 16395, 'Rake'), ('agent', 16395, 'TFIDF'), ('use', 16395, 'Rake'), ('time', 16395, 'Rake'), ('self', 16395, 'Rake'), ('natural rate', 16395, 'Rake'), ('indenture performs', 16395, 'Rake'), ('incentive', 16395, 'Rake'), ('indenture', 16395, 'Rake'), ('higher', 16395, 'textRank'), ('half', 16395, 'TFIDF'), ('banknote', 16395, 'Rake'), ('cooperation', 16395, 'Rake'), ('intention', 16395, 'Rake'), ('prepayment', 16395, 'Rake'), ('indenture', 16395, 'TFIDF'), ('delivery', 16395, 'Rake'), ('tearing', 16395, 'TFIDF'), ('principal signals', 16395, 'Rake'), ('indenture game', 16395, 'Rake'), ('banknote', 16395, 'TFIDF'), ('self', 16395, 'textRank')]"
7,31332,"The real interest partity (RIP) condition combines two cornerstones in international finance, uncovered interest parity (UIP) and ex ante purchasing power parity (PPP). The extent of deviation from RIP is therefore an indicator of the lack of product and financial market integration. This paper investigates whether the nominal exchange rate regime has an impact on RIP. The analysis is based on 15 annual real interest rates and covers a long time span, 1870-2006. Four subperiods are distinguished and linked to fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes: the Gold Standard, the interwar float, the Bretton Woods system and the current managed float. Panel integration techniques are used to increase the power of the tests. Cross section correlation is embedded via common factor structures. The results suggest that RIP holds as a long run condition irrespectively of the exchange rate regimes. Adjustment towards RIP is affected by the institutional framework and the historical episode. Half lives of shocks tend to be lower under fixed exchange rates and in the first part of the sample, probably due to higher price flexibility before WWII. Although barriers to foreign trade and capital controls were substantially removed after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, they did not lead to lower half lives during the managed float.",98445,This paper explores the importance of housing and mortgage market heterogeneity in 13 European countries for the transmission of monetary policy. We use a pooled VAR model which is estimated over the period 1995-2006 to generate impulse responses of key macroeconomic variables to a monetary policy shock. We split our sample of countries into two disjoint groups according to the impact of the monetary policy shock on real house prices. Our results suggest that in countries with a more pronounced reaction of real house prices the propagation of monetary policy shocks to macroeconomic variables is amplified.,123270,"Monetary growth in the euro area has exceeded its target since several years. At the same time, the money demand function seems to be increasingly unstable if more recent data are used. If the link between money balances and the macroeconomy is fragile, the rationale of monetary aggregates in the ECB strategy has to be doubted. In fact, a rise in the income elasticity after 2001 can be observed, and may reflect the exclusion of real and financial wealth in conventional specifications of money demand. This presumption is explored by means of a cointegration analysis. To separate income from wealth effects, the specification in terms of money velocity is preferred. Evidence for the presence of wealth in the long run relationship is provided. In particular, both stock and house prices have exerted a negative impact on velocity after 2001 and lead to almost identical equilibrium errors.

The analysis is based on a microsimulation model which accounts for cohort effects in individual employment and unemployment and earnings over the lifecycle as well as the differential impact of recent pension reforms on birth cohorts. Cohort effects estimated on the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) for for individuals born between 1937 and 1971 vary greatly by region, gender and education and strongly affect lifecycle wage profiles, in particular in East Germany and for people with little education. Using simulated life cycle employment and income profiles, we project gross future pensions across cohorts taking into account changing demographics and recent pension reforms. Simulations show that pension levels for East German men and women will fall dramatically among younger birth cohorts, not only because of policy reforms but due to higher cumulated unemployment. For West German men, the small reduction of average pension levels among younger birth cohorts is mainly driven by the impact of pension reforms, while future pension levels of West German women are increasing or stable due to rising labor market participation of younger birth cohorts.",asset prices,challenging areas,provide,inclusion,price bubbles,explore,var models,real,house prices,negative effects,appropriate design,impacts,12,"[('asset prices', 12694, 'Rake'), ('challenging areas', 12694, 'textRank'), ('provide', 12694, 'Rake'), ('inclusion', 12694, 'Rake'), ('price bubbles', 12694, 'Rake'), ('explore', 12694, 'Rake'), ('var models', 12694, 'Rake'), ('real', 12694, 'TFIDF'), ('house prices', 12694, 'Rake'), ('negative effects', 12694, 'textRank'), ('appropriate design', 12694, 'Rake'), ('impacts', 12694, 'Rake'), ('real share', 12694, 'Rake'), ('specifications point', 12694, 'Rake'), ('appropriate design', 12694, 'textRank'), ('real economy', 12694, 'Rake'), ('global vars', 12694, 'Rake'), ('differences', 12694, 'Rake'), ('central banks', 12694, 'Rake'), ('future', 12694, 'Rake'), ('central', 12694, 'textRank'), ('asset', 12694, 'TFIDF'), ('speculative', 12694, 'TFIDF'), ('hot', 12694, 'TFIDF'), ('asset markets', 12694, 'Rake'), ('measure', 12694, 'Rake'), ('area', 12694, 'textRank'), ('negative effects', 12694, 'Rake'), ('monetary policy rule', 12694, 'Rake'), ('impact', 12694, 'Rake'), ('house', 12694, 'TFIDF'), ('prices', 12694, 'TFIDF'), ('liquidity', 12694, 'TFIDF'), ('liquidity', 12694, 'Rake'), ('influence', 12694, 'Rake'), ('euro', 12694, 'textRank'), ('shocks', 12694, 'TFIDF'), ('results', 12694, 'Rake'), ('monetary', 12694, 'TFIDF'), ('international spillovers', 12694, 'Rake'), ('formation', 12694, 'Rake'), ('recent years', 12694, 'Rake'), ('financial market integration', 12694, 'Rake'), ('monetary policy', 12694, 'Rake'), ('wealth prices', 12694, 'Rake'), ('banks', 12694, 'textRank'), ('euro area', 12694, 'Rake'), ('control', 12694, 'Rake'), ('bubbles', 12694, 'TFIDF'), ('affected', 12694, 'Rake'), ('rise', 12694, 'Rake'), ('liquidity shocks', 12694, 'Rake')]",[]
8,30521,"A shortage of skilled labor and low female labor market participation are problems many developed countries have to face. Beside activating inactive women, one possible solution is to support the re-integration of unemployed women. Due to female-specific labor market constraints (preferences for exible working hours, discrimination), this is a difficult task, and the question arises whether active labor market policies (ALMP) are an appropriate tool to do so. Promoting self-employment among the unemployed might be promising. Starting their own business might give women more independence and exibility in allocating their time to work and family. Access to long-term informative data allows us to close existing research gaps, and we investigate the impact of two start-up programs on long-run labor market and fertility outcomes of female participants. We find that start-up programs persistently integrate former unemployed women into the labor market and partly improve their income situations. The impact on fertility is less detrimental than for traditional ALMP programs.",87030,"The EU advocates a household waste recycling rate of more than 70%. Although the Netherlands already years ago invested in recycling policies heavily, this is still a large challenge as nowadays on average this rate is approximately 50% and nearly no municipalities have a rate above 70%. Given the experience, it is possible to learn from the Dutch experience which policies are effective in increasing the recycling rates. Based on a large panel data set for the Netherlands , we show that unit-based pricing, avoiding a duo-bin or unsorted and compostable waste, and moving back the frequency of collecting unsorted and compostable waste at the curbside are effective in raising the recycling rate. However, only unit-based pricing has a substantial effect. In nearly all cases changing the frequency of collection of recyclables had no or very small effects. We find some evidence for the effectiveness of adding bring locations to curbside collection. Based on an estimation of the cost function most policies have no effect on costs, except for unit-based pricing (saving on cost) and increases in the frequency of unsorted waste collection (cost increasing). Overall, it seems nearly impossible to reach the EU-goal of 70% with the policies applied.",13142,"Welfare-state measures often tend to persist even when they seem to have become suboptimal due to changes in the economic environment.

In this model, welfare-state persistence arises from disincentive effects of social insurance on attentiveness.

The starting point is a scoping study by Cambridge Econometrics and Sustainable Europe Research Institute (SERI) that reviews a large number of macroeconomic models investigating their ability to provide information on the interlinkages between the economy and the environment required from a sustainability viewpoint. This scoping study yields two key recommendations for macroeconomic modelling: to incorporate resource use in the explanation of economic development, and to allow for non-linear relationships, thresholds and limits (Serice 2010). The report then turns to another useful approach from OECD that makes an effort to conceptualize causal pathways linking global environmental change (originally: climate change) to economic development via policy regulations, direct biophysical impacts and price effects on global markets (OECD/Martinez-Fernandez et al. 2010). The three types of effects are discussed. In a next section, insights from a report from the FP7-NEUjobs project are presented. In this project, a wide array of (mainly) natural science literature had been screened to identify “global megatrends” that would impact European economies and policy-making. Given far-reaching uncertainties and complex interrelations, the megatrends identified (i.e. energy transitions, rising challenges to resource security and increasing climate change impacts) are grouped to envision two future world contexts for Europe, a “tough” and a more “friendly” world. For the year 2025, the features of these worlds are sketched on the basis of a literature review (NEUjobs 2012). The chapter concludes that indeed the availability and use of natural resources provides a key link between economies and the environment, but that it is advisable to deal with them not one by one, but in a systemic fashion that takes into account their strong interrelationships on the one hand, and the high uncertainty of constraints of particular resources on the other. It concludes that the future of European resource supply may be expected to be fairly different from the past, and should be expected to change to the worse, both for environmental reasons and for reasons of strongly increasing international demand and competition. Chapter 2 is devoted to a descriptive analysis of the changes in global and European resource use in the past and emphasises the non-linearities that can be observed. It focuses on long-term structural changes in the energetic base of socio-economic systems, leading to fundamental transformations in the scale and quality of society-nature interactions. Similar fundamental transformations should be expected for the (inevitable) transition from fossil to renewable energy sources. Based on a set of case studies of industrial countries for which long term data series for resource use (material and energy use) are available, it discusses the transition from the agrarian to the industrial metabolic regime and seeks to identify structural breaks in the development of energy use in the second half of the 20th century. The main finding is that a stabilization of per capita energy and resource use in most high-income countries was reached in the early 1970ies that is still lasting, after a period of accelerated growth of resource use since the end of World War II. During this time the so-called „decoupling? of energy and materials use from economic growth became much more pronounced, a phenomenon we describe as the “1970s syndrome”. An explanation of this common and marked turn in the upward trend of energy and materials consumption needs more research and will be further pursued in work package 201. Finally, Chapter 3 suggests four scenarios for European resource use up to the year 2050, aligning with the global resource use scenarios developed by UNEP?s International Resource Panel (2011). A “trend scenario” prolonging Europe?s resource use into the future proves to be very close to the “freezing” scenario proposed by UNEP for high income industrial countries, and leads to an average per-capita resource use in Europe on the same level as in the early 2000s. A “best practice scenario” generalizes the past success of some European countries in downsizing their resource use to all European countries up to 2050. The fourth scenario, the 2 “radical transformation scenario”, follows UNEP?s “moderate contraction and convergence” scenario in halving the per capita annual resource use of European countries, leading to what is commonly called “absolute decoupling”. The last part of the chapter is devoted to the feasibility of such a scenario, on the one hand, and the consequences this might have for the European economies. The concluding remarks emphasize that a successful scenario exercise requires an intimate collaboration between macroeconomic modellers and scientists contributing from the environmental and socio-ecological angle. There will be place for such collaboration in the further course of the WWWforEurope project.",hold,best decision,traditional economic theory describes economic agents,third,information,real world,ability,approach,arrive,rational,traditional economic theory describes economic agents,macroeconomic,1,"[('hold', 104451, 'Rake')]","[('best decision', 104451, 'Rake'), ('traditional economic theory describes economic agents', 104451, 'Rake'), ('third', 104451, 'Rake'), ('information', 104451, 'Rake'), ('real world', 104451, 'Rake'), ('ability', 104451, 'Rake'), ('approach', 104451, 'Rake'), ('arrive', 104451, 'Rake'), ('rational', 104451, 'TFIDF'), ('traditional economic theory describes economic agents', 104451, 'textRank'), ('macroeconomic', 104451, 'textRank'), ('decisions', 104451, 'TFIDF'), ('reasons', 104451, 'Rake'), ('costly', 104451, 'Rake'), ('economic agents', 104451, 'Rake'), ('boundedly', 104451, 'TFIDF'), ('possession', 104451, 'TFIDF'), ('transition', 104451, 'TFIDF'), ('important behavioural biases', 104451, 'Rake'), ('posses', 104451, 'textRank'), ('transition policies', 104451, 'Rake'), ('process', 104451, 'Rake'), ('agents posses', 104451, 'Rake'), ('optimal decisions', 104451, 'Rake'), ('assumption', 104451, 'Rake'), ('information relevant', 104451, 'Rake'), ('sustainability transition', 104451, 'Rake'), ('provide', 104451, 'Rake'), ('necessary information', 104451, 'Rake'), ('posses', 104451, 'TFIDF'), ('number', 104451, 'Rake'), ('agents', 104451, 'TFIDF'), ('influence', 104451, 'Rake'), ('profit', 104451, 'Rake'), ('approach', 104451, 'textRank'), ('list', 104451, 'Rake'), ('economic', 104451, 'TFIDF'), ('second', 104451, 'Rake'), ('possession', 104451, 'Rake'), ('choices', 104451, 'Rake'), ('information', 104451, 'TFIDF')]"

Then, we explore the relation between market access and economic activity empirically. We simulate the impact of enlargement on EU Objective 1 regions. Predicted market-access induced gains in regional GDP and manufacturing employment are up to seven times larger in regions proximate to the new accession countries than in ?interior? EU regions.

A credible monetary regime that delivers on the final target of price stability gives a basis for inflation expectations firmly anchored around price stability, which facilitate the use of multiyear nominal wage contracts and a higher degree of decentralised wage formation among forwardlooking workers and employers. Lack of credibility of a monetary regime that results in high and volatile inflation makes shorter wage contracts based on centralised wage bargaining more attractive and encourages the use of inflation indexation of nominal wages. If labourmarket structures to some extent are endogenously dependent on the monetary regime, results and policy conclusions from theoretical models that treats these part of the economy as exogenous might be questionable.",126199,"This paper employs the Time Varying Panel Smooth Transition Regression (TV-PSTR) model to investigate the effects of India's dramatic trade liberalization starting from 1991 on market efficiency and productivity growth using Indian manufacturing firm data. We find that the effects of liberalization do follow a smooth transition process instead of previously assumed instantaneous ""big-bang"" shift just after reforms. It actually took years for the Indian firms to start to react to the reforms, and the transitional impact of reforms takes approxi- mately 4-8 years to complete, with different timing across industries. There is strong evidence of increase in competition, which pushes down the markup and make it possible to get welfare gains from reduction of dead weight losses. In response to trade reforms, most industries, which suffer most from the shrinking of market size experienced no change or falling total factor productivity (TFP) growth; whereas leather industry, as the industry which benefit most from economy of scales, enjoyed a huge TFP growth in response to reforms. This evidence is consistent with the endogenous growth model prediction, which says TFP growth after liberalization depends on whether trade is encouraging R&D and innovation or discouraging it.",21625,dissim,"This paper analyses the effect of information disseminated by the Internet on voting behavior.

After having discussed these problems, a different way of measuring counterterrorism effectiveness is outlined. It rests on the assumption that counterterrorism should be broken down into separate components that should all be evaluated separately.

13,12655,The aim of the study is to quantify climate induced health risks for Germany. Based on high resolution climate scenarios for the period 2071 to 2100 we forecast the number of days with heat load and cold stress. The heat frequency and intensity increases overall but more in the south. Referring to empirical studies on heat induced health effects we estimate an average increase in the number of heat induced casualties by a factor of more than 3. Heat related hospitalization costs increase 6-fold not including the cost of ambulant treatment. Heat also reduces the work performance resulting in an estimated output loss of between 0.12 % and 0.48 % of GDP.,15211,"The appropriate way of quantifying how taxation of a firm's income and capital can distort its optimizing conditions is a recurring issue in the literature on optimal taxation. Exponential decay, although empirically contested, is almost ubiquitous. In the present paper a generalized framework which allows for a general, non-exponential, decay pattern for both true and tax-permitted depreciation, is considered. Both convex and concave survival functions can be accommodated. Three capital concepts are involved, two of which coincide under exponential decay. The trade-of between various departures from neutrality is illustrated. Elements which contribute to non-neutrality are: (i) discrepancy between the definition of the tax-relevant accounting capital and true depreciation, (ii) mis-indexation of depreciation allowances, (iii) incomplete deductibility of interest costs, (iv) asymmetric treatment of interest costs and capital gains, and (v) taxation of the value of the capital stock. Finally, we show that substantial biases can arise in assessing the degree of non-neutrality if non-exponential depreciation schedules are forced, by 'approximation devices', to fit into the exponential decay schedule.",27178,"Parental entrepreneurship is a strong, probably the strongest, determinant of own entrepreneurship. We explore the origins of this intergenerational association in entrepreneurship. In particular, we identify the separate effects of pre- and post-birth factors (nature and nurture), by using a unique dataset of Swedish adoptees. Its unique characteristic is that it not only includes data on occupational status for the adoptees and their adoptive parents, but also for their biological parents. Moreover, we use comparable data on entrepreneurship for a large, representative sample of the Swedish population. Based on the latter sample, and consistent with previous findings, we show that parental entrepreneurship increases the probability of children's entrepreneurship by about 60%. We further show that for adoptees, both biological and adoptive parents make significant contributions. These effects, however, are quite different in size. The effect of post-birth factors (adoptive parents) is approximately twice as large as the effect of pre-birth factors (biological parents). The sum of these two effects for adopted children is almost identical to the intergenerational transmission of entrepreneurship for own-birth children. We explore several candidate explanations for this important post-birth effect and present suggestive evidence in favor of role modeling.",79872,intermediate,"We investigate the welfare impact of parallel imports using a large panel data set containing monthly information on sales, ex-factory prices, and further product characteristics for all 700 antidiabetic drugs sold in Germany between 2004 and 2010.

We finally evaluate the effect of the parallel imports' policy by calculating a counter-factual scenario without parallel trade. According to our estimates, parallel imports reduce the prices for patented and generic drugs by 39% and 0.05%, respectively. This amounts to an increase in the demand-side surplus by 11.4 million per year which is relatively small compared to the market size of around 470million.

This paper uses the augmented Solow-Swan model of Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992) to analyze data on provinces of China over the reform period 1978-2003. Our main finding is that FDI has a positive and statistically significant impact on economic growth as theory predicts and the augmented Solow-Swan model provides an excellent fit of the data.

In most cross-country regressions, aid is considered effective only if it shifts recipient countries to a significantly higher and sustainable growth path. We apply an alternative approach which is less demanding, based on the concept of temporary growth accelerations suggested by Hausmann, Pritchett and Rodrik. In assessing what can reasonably be expected from the donors' modest aid efforts, we do not only employ aggregate aid data but we also differentiate between major aid categories, including grants, loans and so-called short-impact aid. It turns out that aid flows have a small but significantly positive effect on the conditional probability of growth accelerations. This result holds across different estimation methods. Short-impact aid is found to be more effective in this respect, while we reject the view that grants are superior to loans. To the contrary, we find a stronger effect of loans. Furthermore, aid has become more effective during the second half of our sample. Typically, however, the significance of results crucially depends on the criteria applied to identify growth accelerations.",27618,"The returns from individual accounts in pension schemes are subject to fluctuations in capital markets.

In additional to unconditional analysis, we use local projection methods to condition on a broad set of macroeconomic controls and their lags.

These ideas derive from the potential existence of norms around the ideal worker and motherhood. Relevant hypotheses are developed and tested using information on usual and preferred working time from the first two waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey.

The results suggest the presence of nonlinear mean reversion in the nominal exchange rate process. The implications are that different sets of macroeconomic fundamentals act as driving forces of the exchange rates during different time periods. More interestingly, the nonlinear specification significantly improves the forecast accuracy during periods when the deviation between exchange rate and fundamentals is large.

Specifically, it is shown that the main driving forces of the size and development of the shadow economy are unemployment, self-employment and the tax burden, which impact the shadow economies in these 30 OECD countries to a different degree. Between 1999 and 2010 unemployment and self-employment have on average the largest relative impact (14.6%), followed by tax morale (14.5%), GDP growth (14.3%), business freedom (14.2%) and indirect taxes (14.1%).",economy,economic,argue,mimic model,want,helpful,paper presents,driving forces,shadow,indicators,real tax burden,helpful,3,"[('economy', 76930, 'TFIDF'), ('economic', 76930, 'textRank'), ('argue', 76930, 'Rake')]","[('mimic model', 76930, 'Rake'), ('want', 76930, 'TFIDF'), ('helpful', 76930, 'Rake'), ('paper presents', 76930, 'Rake'), ('driving forces', 76930, 'Rake'), ('shadow', 76930, 'TFIDF'), ('indicators', 76930, 'Rake'), ('real tax burden', 76930, 'Rake'), ('helpful', 76930, 'TFIDF'), ('repress', 76930, 'TFIDF'), ('unobservable phenomena', 76930, 'Rake'), ('illusion', 76930, 'TFIDF'), ('creation', 76930, 'Rake'), ('paper presents', 76930, 'textRank'), ('fiscal illusion', 76930, 'Rake'), ('repress shadow economic activities', 76930, 'Rake'), ('fiscal', 76930, 'Rake'), ('shadow economy', 76930, 'Rake'), ('relationship', 76930, 'Rake'), ('104', 76930, 'TFIDF'), ('efforts', 76930, 'Rake'), ('control shadow economic activities', 76930, 'Rake'), ('control', 76930, 'textRank'), ('empirical analysis', 76930, 'Rake'), ('main determinants', 76930, 'Rake'), ('illusion', 76930, 'textRank'), ('government', 76930, 'Rake'), ('shadow economy', 76930, 'textRank'), ('fiscal', 76930, 'TFIDF'), ('confirm previous findings', 76930, 'Rake')]"
17,83737,"Empirical work on Akerlof’s theory of gift exchange in labor markets has concentrated on the fair wage-effort hypothesis. In fact, however, the theory also contains a social component that stipulates that homogenous agents that are employed for the same wage level will exert more effort, resulting in higher rents and higher market efficiency, than agents that receive different wages. We present the first test of this component, which we call the fair uniform-wage hypothesis. In our laboratory experiment, we establish the existence of a significant efficiency premium of uniform wages. However, it is not the consequence of a stronger level of reciprocity by agents, but of the retrenchment of sanctioning options on the side of principals with uniform wages. Hence, implementing limitations to contractual freedom can have efficiency-enhancing effects.",31116,"We compare performance in a word based creativity task under three incentive schemes: a flat fee, a linear payment and a tournament.

Our test combines factor price data from Japan's late autarky period with Japan's factor content of trade calculated with the technologies of the country of origin of traded goods. The direct and indirect input requirements are constructed from many historical sources, including a major Japanese survey of agricultural techniques and a rich set of 19th century comparative cost studies.

18,31285,"Do firms have proper incentives to invest in electronic coordination? We discuss this question in an oligopoly model with a local firm and a distant competitor that may reduce transport costs by investing in electronic coordination. In a two-stage game with investment in the first stage and price or quantity competition with differentiated products in the second stage we compare profit maximizing investment with (constrained) welfare maximization by a social planer. Depending on market demand, firm conduct and investment costs either over- or underinvestment may result: The firm will overinvest if the negative impact on its competitor exceeds the gain in consumer surplus. This is shown to be especially likely under quantity competition with (almost) homogenous products.",100002,"In this study, we employ the novel measure of a VAR-based spillover index, developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) to investigate the time-varying relationship between tourism and economic growth in selected European countries. Overall, the findings suggest that (i) the tourism-economy relationship is not stable over time in terms of both its magnitude and direction, (ii) the relationship exhibits patterns in its magnitude and/or direction during major economic events, such as the Great Recession of 2007 and the Eurozone debt crisis of 2010, and (iii) the impact of these economic events on the relationship between the tourism sector and the economy is more apparent to Cyprus, Greece, Portugal and Spain, which are the European countries that have experienced the most severe economic downturn since 2009. These results are important to tourism actors and policy makers, suggesting that they should pay particular attention to this time-varying relationship and the factors that influence it when designing their tourism strategies. In addition, the findings of this study carry significant implications for researchers, as they underline a strand of the literature which deserves further attention.",17704,"Firms in an R&D race actively manage rivals’ beliefs by disclosing and concealing information on their cost of investment. The firms’ disclosure strategies affect their incentives to invest in R&D, and to acquire information. We compare equilibria under voluntary disclosure with those under mandatory disclosure in a model where the firms’ cost of investment are identically independently distributed. Under voluntary disclosure firms conceal bad news, and disclose good news only if little knowledge spills over to their rival. Under mandatory disclosure firms expect higher profits for given information acquisition investments, but they may acquire less information.",31276,sim,"One of the most recently observed stylised facts in the field of economic growth is the persistent bimodal shape of the world income distribution.. Of course, some theoretical explanations for this new stylised fact already have been provided by neoclassical growth theory within a maximising framework. Although innovation and technology are recognised as being the driving forces behind growth processes, these models maintain the restrictive assumption of a rational acting representative agent. In this paper we draw on a synergetic approach of evolutionary economics. In the model, the countries' productivity development is depicted as a sequence of relative technological levels and the movement from one level to the next higher one is governed by stochastic transition rates. The motivation for these transition rates is based on the knowledge-based approach of evolutionary economics, thereby taking into account depleting technological opportunities, the effects of technological infrastructure and permanent technological obsolescence due to an ubiquitous scientific progress. With this model we are able to show how a persistent bimodal distribution - the twin peaks - endogenously emerges via self-organisation. This simulated distribution matches well with the kernel density plot, calculated for GDP per worker data relative to the GDP per worker in the USA over the period 1960-90 for a sample of 104 countries. Both the empirical and theoretical results show an evolution of the density function toward bimodality with a decreasing number of countries with low relative productivity levels and an increasing number of countries with high relative productivity levels, indicating a prevalent catching-up during the period of investigation. However, the separation of both groups of countries is getting more significant over time and therefore further catching-up is expected to become increasingly difficult in the future.",effect,profits,market,profits,effect,consumers,substantial,product differentiation,preference,electronic,case,differentiated,6,"[('effect', 31276, 'textRank'), ('profits', 31276, 'TFIDF'), ('market', 31276, 'textRank'), ('profits', 31276, 'Rake'), ('effect', 31276, 'Rake'), ('consumers', 31276, 'textRank')]","[('substantial', 31276, 'Rake'), ('product differentiation', 31276, 'Rake'), ('preference', 31276, 'Rake'), ('electronic', 31276, 'TFIDF'), ('case', 31276, 'Rake'), ('differentiated', 31276, 'textRank'), ('product differentiation dominates', 31276, 'Rake'), ('markets', 31276, 'textRank'), ('magnitude', 31276, 'Rake'), ('products', 31276, 'textRank'), ('costs', 31276, 'TFIDF'), ('digitalizable products', 31276, 'Rake'), ('mode', 31276, 'TFIDF'), ('space', 31276, 'Rake'), ('increase', 31276, 'Rake'), ('model', 31276, 'Rake'), ('negative effect', 31276, 'Rake'), ('producers depends', 31276, 'Rake'), ('extended consumer base due', 31276, 'Rake'), ('case profits', 31276, 'Rake'), ('transport', 31276, 'textRank'), ('product differentiation', 31276, 'textRank'), ('consumer surplus', 31276, 'Rake'), ('rise', 31276, 'Rake'), ('use', 31276, 'Rake'), ('differentiated', 31276, 'TFIDF'), ('transport costs', 31276, 'Rake'), ('result', 31276, 'Rake'), ('impact', 31276, 'Rake'), ('products', 31276, 'TFIDF'), ('products', 31276, 'Rake'), ('analyze', 31276, 'Rake'), ('digitalizable', 31276, 'TFIDF'), ('point', 31276, 'Rake'), ('positive effect', 31276, 'Rake'), ('transport', 31276, 'TFIDF'), ('electronic market mode', 31276, 'Rake'), ('present paper', 31276, 'Rake'), ('digital', 31276, 'Rake'), ('differentiation', 31276, 'TFIDF'), ('degree', 31276, 'Rake'), ('consumer', 31276, 'textRank')]"

We estimate the effects of revenue decentralization and earmarked grant financing on the level of sub-national infrastructure investment in 20 European countries over the period 1990-2009. The results are interpreted in light of the predictions of the theory on fiscal federalism.
